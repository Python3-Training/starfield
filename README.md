# starfield

A colorized, readily re-sizable starfield simulation using Python 3 & Tkinter.

If you would like to learn how to use Python to create such graphics, then [you might enjoy my training](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-turtle-graphics).

To join our happy band of Pythoneers, also feel free to join us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Python3Training).

p.s. If you would like to plack (play + hack -=> Kobayashi Maru?) a game then you might enjoy [StarTrek for Python](https://github.com/Python3-Training/startrek1971).
